{Description of the Project / Application}
Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)

 {Instructions}
 IN this project i used prompt. Therefore will prompt the user to input. This is how the Triangle Tracker works:
 I created a click button,therefore when the user clicks it a prompt dialog box pops us. This will prompt the user to enter to the digits

 Enter the values of the three sides of the triangles
 If an Isosceles triangle, only two values would be the same so it will alert Isosceles triangle.
 If an Equilateral triangle, all the values are the same, so it will alert Equilateral triangle.
 If Scalene triangles, the sum of two values will be greater than the third, so it will alert Scalene triangle


{Setup/Installation Requirements}
You need to install Atom, Visual Studio Code and Js fiddle for this project to work.

|Behavior What program it handles           |input                  | output           
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
|If two sides are equal                     |side1=2,side2=2,side3=1|Isosceles Triangle  |
|If all sides are equal                     |side1=4,side2=4,side3=4|Equilateral Triangle|
|Sum of two sides are greater than the third|side1=7,side2=6,side3=4|Scalene Triangle    |
|Two sides less than the third side         |side1=1,side2=2,side3=3|Not a triangle      |
