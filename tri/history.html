    <h1>What are Triangles?</h1>
    <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted {\displaystyle \triangle ABC} \triangle ABC</p>
    <p>We have three main types of triangles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Equilateral Triangle"</li>
      <p>has all sides the same length. An equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60Â°</p>

      <li>Isosceles Triangle</li>
      <p>has two sides of equal length.[note 1][2] An isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the two sides of the same length; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. </p>

      <li>Scalene Triangle</li>
      <p>has all its sides of different lengths.[3] Equivalently, it has all angles of different measure.</p>
